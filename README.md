# Luna
Submission for [The Jam "Sun and Moon"](https://dungenrobot.com/jam/01)

A short "game" where you walk around a tiny planet. There is a moon in the sky and dynamic audio. 
The music changes depending on where you are on the planet and what celestial bodies are in your field of view. There are also crickets on the dark side.

The code for keeping the player pointed towards the planet was tricky and I ended up using a tutorial.
